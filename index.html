            <h2>What is Pozole?</h2>
            <p>Pozole is a traditional Mexican dish that is very popular all throughout Mexico. It is a soup made traditionally with pork, chiles, hominy, and garlic. It's very hearty and a staple of Mexican cuisine. Pozole is found in three colors red (rojo), green (verde), and white (blanco) Each made with a different salsa (except pozole blanco). Pozole is usually made for special occasions as it is easiest to make in large amounts and is very time consuming. That's why you'll really only see pozole at quinceaneras, weddings, parties, and other festivities. That's usually when I eat pozole. It's a communal dish that is best enjoyed with friends and family. I always have fond memories of eating it and I hope you will also. That's why I'm sharing this recipe.</p>

            <h2>Where is Pozole From?</h2>
            <p>Pozole dates back all the way to the Aztec empire. It was a dish reserved only for the rich and powerful. Even them only ate during special occasions. Pozole has always been a celebratory dish. They ate pozole to celebrate the gods, a good harvest, and the changing of seasons. Pozole wasn't always made with pork. Pigs were brought over by the Spanish in the 15th century. So what meat would they use? Something very gruesome. Human meat from sacrifices would be used in pozole. When people's hearts were sacrificed to the gods, the leftover meat would be used to make pozole for the elite. The soup to the Aztecs symbolized the permanent duality of the Nahuaâ€™s mystical vision was verified: origin and end, heaven and earth, day and night. When the Spanish came, they abolished cannibalism and replaced the human meat with pork for the recipe. Other than that change, the soup has stayed the same for the past 500 years.</p>

            <h2>The Recipe</h2>
            <p>Pozole is a very time consuming dish that takes hours to make. Here are the steps to make pozole rojo. If you want to make pozole verde make a green salsa, if you want to make pozole blanco don't make a ton of salsa. Only add enough to have some flavor.</p>
            <h4>First we need the ingredients:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>5-10 lbs of espinazo de puerco or pork backbone</li>
                <li>1-2 lbs of lomo which is pork loin.</li>
                <li>2 big cans of hominy, the one we use is Bush's Hominy</li>
                <li>3 Onions</li>
                <li>2-4 Bay leaves</li>
                <li>5 Cloves of Garlic</li>
                <li>Chiles Guajillos, use a lot of these. These are 2,500-5,000 SHU (Scoville Units)</li>
                <li>Chile Pulla, use less than Guajillos. These chiles are smaller and spicier (5,000-8,000 SHU)</li>
                <li><strong>OPTIONAL:</strong> Chile de Arbol, These chiles are spicy (15,000-30,000 SHU) so use with caution. <strong>Do Not</strong> use if you do not have a tolerance for spice. </li>
                <li>Tomatillos</li>
                <li>Tomatoes</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
                <li>Half a Pots Full of Water</li>
                <li>A Tablespoon of Chicken Bullion Powder</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Toppings and Things Eaten with Pozole</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Limes</li>
                <li>Radishes</li>
                <li>Onions</li>
                <li>Tostadas (fried tortillas)</li>
                <li>Sour Cream</li>
                <li>Any salsa</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>VERY IMPORTANT THINGS TO NOTE:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>For all the ingredients <strong>WITHOUT</strong> measurements, you can add as many as you want according to your preference. Don't underutilize the ingredients though.
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>ESPECIALLY</strong> don't underutilize the chiles. If you don't make enough salsa you will end up with pozole blanco.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>This recipe serves <strong>20 people</strong>, if you would like to make pozole in a smaller portion make sure to use less of all the ingredients, just know it's easier to make in larger portions. Pozole is so time consuming that it is usually made in large portions for many people.</li>
                <li>Make sure you are using a pot that can fit all of the ingredients you have. We use a pretty big pot, bigger is better.</li>
                <li>For your meat you can cut it yourself but I recommend buying it pre-cut, it saves a lot of time.</li>
                <li>One last thing: <strong><u>TASTE AS YOU GO!</u></strong> that way you know if you over or under seasoned.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Let's get Started!</p>
            <h4>The Procedure</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Fill up your pot with water and bring it to a boil.</li>
                <li>While your water boils, cut your meat (if you have to), onions, and peel your garlic. <b>For the onions:</b>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Peel them</li>
                        <li>Cut them in half</li>
                        <li>Cut off the edge with the dirt.</li>
                    </ol>
                    This makes them easier to remove later
                </li>
                <li>Add in your meat, onions, 4 pieces of garlic, bay leaf, and salt. You want enough salt where you can taste it a little bit, we usually go for around a handful of salt. Also, make sure not to overuse bay leaves, 2-4 should be fine.</li>
                <li>Cook for one hour</li>
                <li>While that cooks you can begin the salsa that you will add to your pozole, this gives pozole rojo its red coloring. You start that by boiling water in a smaller pot.</li>
                <li>Add your tomatoes and tomatillos after its done boiling.</li>
                <li>While the cooks cut your Chiles and remove their seeds. Chiles are cut like this:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Using cooking scissors, cut off the stem, this should make a hole.</li>
                        <li>Cut down the middle of the chile until you reach the tip.</li>
                        <li>Using a paper towel get rid of as many seeds as you can.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Add your chiles and cook until the tomatoes and tomatillos soften.</li>
                <li>Add all of it into a blender with some garlic cloves and blend until smooth</li>
                <li>After one hour has passed go back to your pozole and with a strainer remove all of the crud that has accumulated on top.</li>
                <li>Cook that for another hour.</li>
                <li>Next cut all of your toppings. Slice radishes, dice onions, and cut your limes.</li>
                <li>Once that hour has passed, using a slotted spoon, take out all of your onions, bayleaf, and garlic.</li>
                <li>Taste your pozole and see if it needs more seasoning. Then add your chicken bullion powder.</li>
                <li>Strain your chile through a strainer and add the liquid to the pozole. This gives the pozole its red color.</li>
                <li>Open your cans of hominy and strain the water out.</li>
                <li>Wash your hominy in cold water</li>
                <li>Add your hominy into your pozole slowly, so you don't spill your broth out.</li>
                <li>Let the pozole cook for another 30 minutes. After that it's ready to serve!</li>
            </ol>
